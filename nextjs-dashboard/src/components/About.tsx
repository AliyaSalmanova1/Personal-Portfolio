            <br/>
            <p>When I took my first coding class during my studies at NYU University, I immediately fell in love with it. 
                Before that I envisioned myself pursuing a career in music, writing compositions for television. 
                However, the logical challenges and creative possibilities inherent in coding captured my interest profoundly.

            As a web developer, I love the opportunity to develop projects independently and collaborate within teams. 
            I've had the privilege of meeting numerous talented individuals who share my enthusiasm for coding along the way.
            </p>

            When I'm not at the computer, you can find me at my favorite karaoke spot, reading, or fussing over my dog.
