                    <p>My music has been performed at New York City venues such as Roulette and National Sawdust,
                        as well as at Opera Omahaâ€™s ONE Festival.
                        I&apos;ve collaborated on multimedia projects with directors from NYU Tisch,
                        and my works have been performed by orchestras and realized through self-made mockups crafted with music technology.
                        I&apos;ve also performed piano at festivals and on television,
                        and written and performed live scores for silent films.

                        Alongside composing, 
                        I&apos;m a software developer with projects ranging from building 
                        interactive kiosk software to creating tools that streamline development workflows. 
                        I&apos;ve worked in web technologies and integrated audio programming, 
                        and I&apos;ve combined these skills to work on sound systems for games released on Steam, 
                        including Do No Harm and Lunar Ascendant. 
                        My background lets me bridge creative and technical disciplines.

                    <p>
                        I&apos;ve studied with acclaimed music editor Suzana Peric, 
                        composer Alba Torremocha, and concert music with Missy Mazzoli, 
                        and I&apos;ve worked as a music theory and piano instructor. 
                        I&apos;m both a logical and creative thinker, and in my free time I love singing, 
                        exploring philosophy and psychology, 
                        enjoying the New York arts scene, and fussing over my dog.
